# Invitation app - Broccoli & Co.
My app for test task for the position of a Junior Android Developer.


## What does the app do?
The application works with the server.
<br>
It allows users to enter their name and e-mail to receive e-mail invitations to the service.
<br>
If a user has already requested an invitation, the page says they are already registered and allows them to cancel the invitation.
<br>
The user can close the application and his data will be saved.
<br>
If the server returns an error (it has one hardcoded e-mail usedemail@blinq.app), the application will report that the e-mail has already been used.

âš  Since this is a test task, the server may stop working.


## Concepts, libraries, and features used
- [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) architecture: to divide the app into layers
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) library: for easy network interactions
- Coroutines: for UI continuity during network interactions
- ViewModel, LiveData and ViewBinding
- SharedPreferences: to save the user's state
- AlertDialogs
